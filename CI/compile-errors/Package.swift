// A CI fixture, not a shipped product. It pins what the telemetry API
// promises the compiler refuses: a measurement that is not a number, a tag
// that is not a tag, a tag from another event. Those promises are the point
// of typed events, and a promise nothing checks is one a refactor quietly
// breaks. `check-telemetry-compile-errors.sh` builds each file in `cases/`
// as this target's only source and requires the build to fail, saying why.
