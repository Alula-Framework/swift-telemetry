/// A value behind a pthread mutex: `Synchronization.Mutex`'s job, done by
/// the platform lock.
///
/// Because ThreadSanitizer cannot see `Mutex` on Linux. Its lock and unlock
/// live in the uninstrumented standard library and hand off through a
/// futex, so TSan never learns that one critical section happens before
/// the next, and reports every contended one as a race — four threads
/// appending to an array inside `Mutex.withLock` are enough (DECISIONS.md
/// has the reproducer). This package's CI runs a ThreadSanitizer stress
/// test, and a gate
/// that cries wolf on every lock is no gate. TSan intercepts
/// `pthread_mutex_lock`, so this one it sees.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` — the one place this package asserts it: the state
/// is reachable only inside `withLock`, under the mutex.
